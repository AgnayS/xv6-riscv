All of us deserve an A in this project as we worked tirelessly to integrate threads to work as lightweight processes without defining its own type.
We have reused a lot of the core functionality from processses within the same function instead of creating new thread specific functions.
We also reused reference counting from our COW lab that gave us cleaner code as we didn't have to maintain reference counts in proc.cleaner
Our list.c implementation also extends the linux kernel's and contains an isEmpty function that allows for cleaner code while traversing said list.
Our tests, although simple, extensively stress test threads and also showcase thread creation and use lucidly.
